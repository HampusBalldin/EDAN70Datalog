 $Datalog^M$ supports cross-compilation, or pretty-printing, to Souffle. The pretty-printing implementation nicely highlights the power of JastAdd. The AST is kept in a Java class hierarchy with ASTNode as a common ancestor of all classes.
Aspects enable the addition of methods to a generated AST-class. An overview of the design for extensible pretty-printing is shown in in figure \ref{figure:pretty}. To enable re-use of existing pretty-printing functionality, the argument, \textit{PrettyPrinter}, recursively calls back into the corresponding printing method. The evaluation then proceeds by mutual recursion between \textit{pretty} and \textit{souffle}. In this way, a new pretty-printer can be added that alters or mixes the behavior of existing pretty-printers. The type-checking program is generated in the same way by declaring a \textit{TypePrettyPrinter} class.

\subsection{Souffle Evaluation}
Souffle does not support meta-predicates and so naturally it does not recognize the meta-semantics introduced in the previous section. In particular the presence of meta-predicates that the interpreter provides to the Datalog program will fail if a straight forward pretty-printing is performed. The obvious solution then is to first evaluate the Datalog program up to the point that all such predicates are known in a pre-processing step. All the derived special predicates can then be provided to Souffle as additional facts by printing them in the pretty-printing step.

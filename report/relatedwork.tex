\subsection{Souffle}
Souffle implements a semi-naive evaluation\cite{Green:2013:DRQ:2688167.2688168} and performs a range of different optimizations before emitting highly templated C++ code\cite{Scholz:2016:FLP:2892208.2892226}. It focuses on performance and is for example used in program analysis\cite{Smaragdakis:2010:UDF:2185923.2185939}. It does not provide meta-predicates but instead uses special directives to declare what files should be used as EDBs, what relations should be outputted, and what the type of a predicate is. It does however provide a number of built-in functions and aggregates that are not supported by $Datalog^M$\cite{SouffleHome}.

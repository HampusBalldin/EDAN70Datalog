This paper describes a working Datalog implementation with a number of extensions to the core Datalog semantics. In particular, the addition of predicate references in conjunction with a number of meta-predicates permit compact descriptions of Datalog programs. Together with cross-compilation to another more efficient Datalog implementation such as Souffle, \datalogM has the potential to grow into a useful Meta-Compilation system for specifying Datalog programs. Even so, performance is one area where \datalogM is currently lacking. The evaluation shows that two optimizations in particular would be worthwhile; implementing Semi-naive evaluation, and to add relation indexing in order to decrease the time-complexity of the \textit{join}-operation.

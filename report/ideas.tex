\paragraph{Validity Checks}\NL
All usages/partial defs of a predicate must use the same number of terms.

\paragraph{Sanity Checks}\NL
Unused Predicate warning
Unused EDB

\paragraph{Safety Checks}\NL
All facts must be ground.
All variable terms in a head must be bound in the body.

\subsubsection{Evaluation}
Evaluation can be done in a number of different ways. Either iterative or recursive, bottom-up or top-down.

\paragraph(Recursive Top-Down Query Proofs)\nl

\begin{enumerate}
\item Collect all (ground) facts.
\item Let predicate under evaluation be P(x1, ..., xn).
\item Collect all rules that define P.
\item Do a Memoized Backtracking Search (Top-Down).
\item Construct and AND-OR tree. Unify free-variables at AND-nodes.
\item The OR-Branches are the different rules that can be used to prove the (x1, ..., xn) in P,
i.e. all the rules that define P.
\end{enumerate}

Thus need to have a set of ground facts.
Associate each predicate with a collection of rules that define it.

Enable compile to datalog implementation X.

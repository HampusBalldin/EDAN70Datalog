\subsection{Correctness}
The souffle pretty-printer is used to output a Datalog program that may be evaluated by souffle. The process of comparing the output of souffle to that of the internal interpreter has been automated and a range of tests written. If the tests agree then the souffle pretty-printer is said to be correct for the test program. Given that souffle correctly implements Datalog, the interpreter too is concluded to be correct for the given test program. The test cases are selected to cover mutual recursion, negation, meta-predicates, and the other various language extensions.
